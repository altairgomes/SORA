Using and Citing SORA
=====================

Citing
------


SORA is a free software, and we kindly ask users that make use of it (or of part of it), especially in
projects that results in scientific publications, to include the following citation:

::

    Gomes-Júnior et al. (2022). SORA: Stellar occultation reduction and analysis.
    MNRAS, Volume 511, Issue 1, March 2022, Pages 1167–1181
    DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stac032


The scientific documentation of SORA is described in the paper available on Monthly Notices
of the Royal Astronomical Society, which can be accessed on the following links:

Also, for a scientific publication, please be attentive the following terms of use for 
co-authorship:

1. If you *participate in the collaboration Rio/Granada/Paris* and use SORA for the analysis of 
   *objects within the collaboration* (e.g. TNOs, Centaurs, giant planets Trojans, among others), 
   the SORA team may have the possibility to decide if any of its PIs should be co-author of the 
   publication. In this case, the SORA team will commit to:
   
   * Teach the functionalities of the SORA package in a hands-on session or individually;
   * Run SORA, if necessary;
   * Fix any bug - in SORA code - with urgency;
   * Implement new requested features with high priority.

2. If you *participate in the collaboration Rio/Granada/Paris* and use SORA for the analysis of 
   *objects outside the collaboration* (e.g. Main-Belt Asteroids, NEAs, among others), the SORA 
   team will not demand the possibility to become a co-author, but the code should be properly
   cited as stated above.

3. If you are *NOT from the Rio/Granada/Paris collaboration* and use SORA for the analysis of *any 
   object*, the SORA team will not demand the possibility to become a co-author, but the code should
   be properly cited as stated above.


As a drawback for itens 2 and 3, the SORA team will NOT commit to:
   * Teach the functionalities of the SORA package in a hands-on session or individually;
   * Run SORA;
   * Fix any bug - in SORA code - with urgency, unless it is a critical bug;
   * Implement new requested features with high priority;


In the event of granting priority or special attention to the user by the SORA team, further discussions will be made to address the addition of a specific co-author (or co-authors) from the team in the publication.
